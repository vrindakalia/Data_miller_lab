title: 'Worm metabolomics 3'
---

So far, we have worked with the two files needed for metabolomics analysis - the map file and the feature table.  

Last time, we:  

*  wrangled the files to the appropriate format.  
*  we merged the two files to determine the sample identity.  
*  we created a PCA plot using the prcomp() function in base R and created a biplot using the ggbiplot() function.  

Today, we will:  

*  create github repo and upload the metabolomics file to github.  
*  clean the feature table and create the appropriate format for analysis in metaboanalyst.
