**mz.min**: lower bound of mz window for feature matching  

**mz.max**: upper bound of mz window for feature matching  

**NumPres.All.Samples**: number of samples including replicates with non-missing values  

**NumPres.Biological.Sample**: number of "biological samples" with non-missing values in at least 2 out of 3 replicates   

**median_CV**: median coefficient of variation (%) within technical replicates  

**Qscore**: Quality score, defined as the ratio of the percentage of biological samples for which > 50% of technical replicates have a signal to the % median CV; A higher Qscore means the feature is more quantitatively reproducible within technical replicates is detected   

**Max.Intensity**: Maximum intensity of the mz across all samples
