To install ggbiplot, try one of the following:  

1.  Install from github: 

```{r devtools, echo = T, eval = F}
install.packages("devtools") # if you dont already have devtools installed
devtools::install_github("vqv/ggbiplot", force = TRUE)

### OR

install.packages("remotes") # if remotes not already installed
remotes::install_github("vqv/ggbiplot")
```


2.  Install source code, and run before calling function (ggbiplot specifically). Go to https://github.com/vqv/ggbiplot and download the zip file. Unzip the folder and save in a location (on local drive, not network) of your choice. When needed, source the appropriate R script, using the code: 

```{r source, echo = T, eval=F}
source("path_to_folder/ggbiplot-master/R/ggbiplot.R")
```
