title: 'Worm metabolomics 2'
---
Last time, we learned about the two files that are used for metabolomics analysis in R: the feature table and the map file.   

We learned how to read these files into R, and manipulated them to the right format for downstream analysis.  

Today, we will continue working with metabolomics data in R.

*  We will merge the feature table and map file.  

*  We will run a PCA using the prcomp() function in base R.  

*  We will use ggbiplot to create a biplot with PC1 and PC2.  

*  We will begin maniplulating the feature table to meet formatting requirements for [MetaboAnalyst](https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/MetaboAnalyst/faces/home.xhtml).  

*  Before we wrap up, we will create a github repository and link the R project we created last time to this repo and push our scripts to github. Next time, we will push these changes to github.
