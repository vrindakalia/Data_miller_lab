title: "Worm metabolomics 1"
---

We have been developing our skills in R and learning about the tidyverse universe. Today we will spend time with  metabolomics data analysis using R. I hope we  can:  

*  Import the two files needed for metabolomics analysis  

    *  the feature table
    *  the map file  
    
*  We will look at what information is stored in these files.   

*  We will manipultate the feature table and create a PCA plot with the data generated for daf-16 and wildtype worms run on a HRMS in the Clinical biomarkers lab at Emory University.  

*  We will create an R project with the metabolomics folder and use the git workflow to push the files and changes we make to the github repository with the same name (please create  a private repo).
